# Proposal

## Research topic

  
## Data availability
  We will draw on datasets from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) in our analyses:
  1. The [CDC United States Drought Monitor](https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/United-States-Drought-Monitor-2000-2016/spsk-9jj6)   reports weekly drought estimates at the county level for the contiguous United States. The data spans a time period between 2000-2016 and was last updated November 27, 2018.
  2. [NFIRS Public Data](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets/fema-usfa-nfirs-annual-data) contains fire incident information across the US. Each year the U.S. Fire Administration compiles publicly-released NFIRS incidents, collected by states during the previous calendar year, into a public data release. 
  
Static copies of both datasets will be downloaded as CSV files and imported in Rstudio.
