The CDC United States Drought Monitor reports weekly drought estimates at the county level for the contiguous United States. The data spans a time period between 2000-2016 and was last updated November 27, 2018. 2. NFIRS Public Data contains fire incident information across the US. Each year the U.S. Fire Administration compiles publicly-released NFIRS incidents, collected by states during the previous calendar year, into a public data release. Static copies of both datasets will be downloaded as CSV files and imported in Rstudio.
