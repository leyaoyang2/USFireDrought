There’s no doubt that the wildfires and drought are raising more attention in the recent years. In fact, wildfires have become a symbol of the summer or fall in many locations around the county. Wildfires can cause property damage, disrupt transportation, deteriorate air quality, and lead to loss of belongings or even lives among those involved. We are interested in drought and wildfire because they are major natural disasters that can have devastating impacts on the environment and human populations. Droughts can lead to water scarcity, crop failures, and famine while wildfires can cause destruction of ecosystems, displacement of people, and loss of life. Understanding the causes and effects of these disasters can help us manage and prepare for them in the future. The relationship between drought and fire is complex. The timing, intensity, and frequency of drought events may have divergent impacts on fire behavior. Drought and the drying of ecosystems leads to increased fuel in forest understories and grasslands. But is there evidence of drought becoming more common in the United States? Is there evidence of increased number of wildfires? We are intrigued to explore more about the relationship to better help us understand trends in wildfires and drought, and better understand the changing environment. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topic 2.2 Data Availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research Topic We initially began the search for a data source by identifying areas of interest - the members of our group expressed interest in geospatial data and environmental data. The effects of climate change are already tangible in many parts of the country and the world. For example, for two of our group members from California, USA, increased frequency and severity of drought and wildfire is already a reality. For this reason, analyzing environmental data is relevant to our interest and experiences. Our group is interested in exploring how the frequency, duration and severity of drought, and its relation to the occurrence of wildfires, has changed throughout the United States over time. Using US-based datasets, we would like to answer the following questions: 1. Have droughts in the USA become more frequent over time? Have they become more severe over time? Have certain areas become more or less prone to drought than others? 2. Have wildfires in the USA become more frequent or severe over time? Are certain locations now more prone to wildfire or less prone to wildfire? 3. Are changes in the frequency, duration, severity and location of drought related to similar trends in wildfire occurrence? In areas that have become more drought-prone, are wildfires now more common? 2.2 Data Availability We will draw on datasets from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) in our analyses. We chose to analyze two datasets because we are interested in both drought and wildfire trends and the relationship between the two, and we found excellent data sources for each trend maintained separately. The two datasets chosen are detailed below: The CDC United States Drought Monitor reports weekly drought estimates at the county level throughout the contiguous United States. This data was originally recorded as part of the United States Drought Monitor, a collaborative program jointly produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. This information is included in a metadata file maintained on the CDC website. The data was provided to the CDC by the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites - North Carolina. The data is maintained by the CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network and used to generate drought measures. The data spans a time period between 2000-2016 and was last updated November 27, 2018. Each week, each county in the contiguous (lower 48) United States and Washington DC, encoded by a combination of state ID and county ID or FIPS, has a recorded ordinal value describing the drought status. The data is available in .csv format and contains 2.8 million rows - it can be read directly into R. NFIRS Public Data contains fire incident information across the US. The data is provided by the US Fire Administration’s National Fire Data Center. Each year the U.S. Fire Administration compiles publicly-released NFIRS incidents, collected by states during the previous calendar year, into a public data release. The data is collected based on uniform codes that fire departments use to report on the characteristics of incidents to which they respond, including but not limited to fires. Each year, the data is released as a collection of separate text files delimited by the “^” character. Additional text files contain more detail about specific incidents including fires, hazardous materials etc. To analyze the data, the text files for each year were be read into R, then combined into one DataFrame and filtered only to include wildfire-related incidents, then saved. In other words, some pre-processing was required and performed locally due to the large file sizes. Since this data is recorded by fire department personnel, there is some subjectivity when describing an incident’s characteristics (type of structure, cause of fire, etc.) and perhaps some data entry errors and missing values which will have to be addressed throughout the analysis. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning/Transformation 3.3 Missing Value Analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources We have two resources of data: The CDC United States Drought Monitor and Annual NFIRS Public Data. CDC United States Drought Monitor (usdm) The CDC United States Drought Monitor (usdm) describes the drought status on the county level for the contiguous United States. It includes weekly United States Drought Monitor (USDM) data from 2000-2016 provided by the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites - North Carolina. This data is used by the CDC’s National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network to generate drought measures. The time period of the data set is January 4, 2000 – December 27, 2016. The data itself is gathered from more than 350 contributors around the country, each week authored by one lead climatologist. The drought conditions are determined each week from measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations. To be more specific, the dataset includes the following variables: Variable Name Data Type year year of observation int month month of observation int day day of observation int statefips state FIPS identifying code int countyfips county FIPS identifying code int These variables were all read as ints, and were changed to character data as needed once the dataframe was read. Annual NFIRS (National Fire Incident Reporting System) Public Data The annual National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) Public Data Release files are provided by the U.S. Fire Administration’s (USFA) National Fire Data Center (NFDC). The NFIRS is a reporting standard that fire departments use to uniformly report on the full range of their activities, from fire to emergency medical services (EMS) to equipment involved in the response. We use the data between 2004 and 2016. For each year, the data consists of three parts: fires, incidents, and addresses, coming from 3 separate text files. For incidents, we have variables: Variable Name Data Type STATE state str FDID fire department ID int INC_DATE date of incident int INC_NO number of incident int EXP_NO exposure number int TYPE_INC type of incident int For fires, we have variables: Variable Name Data Type STATE state str FDID fire department ID int INC_DATE date of incident int INC_NO number of incident int EXP_NO exposure number int For the address information, we have variables: Variable Name Data Type STATE state str FDID fire department ID int INC_DATE date of incident int INC_NO number of incident int EXP_NO exposure number int CITY city of incident str STATE_ID state of incident str ZIP5 zipcode int 3.2 Cleaning/Transformation CDC United States Drought Monitor (usdm) For the CDC United States. Drought Monitor (usdm) data set, considering the dataset size and completeness, we filtered our data in the range of 2004 to 2016. The dataset is quite clean itself. Thus, we did a few add-on steps to make our data manipulation easier. Add a column that formats date to be in the form of “yy-mm-dd”: we add a column that combines ‘year’, ‘month’, and ‘date’ as strings (characters) then converts to date. Match the value with drought condition as a categorical variable: the value column ranges from 0-4 and are defined as follows: D0: Abnormally Dry; D1: Moderate Drought; D2: Severe Drought; D3: Extreme Drought; D4: Exceptional Drought; No Drought is noted as 9. We added a column to match the value with the corresponding drought condition as a categorical variable to make the data set more understandable. Assign each row to 1 in the count column: adding a count column could help us in counting the number of rows by assigning each row of value 1. Annual NFIRS (National Fire Incident Reporting System) Public Data Create a unique ID for each entry: The unique identifier (primary key) for these incident-associated records is the combination of the State, fire department ID, incident date, incident number, and exposure number (STATE, FDID, INC_DATE, INC_NO, and EXP_NO), according to the NFIRS Design Documentation, Page 8. DataFrame of fires was left-joined with DataFrame of incidents, which was left joined with DataFrame of address information, all on the primary key ‘id’. For consistency, we put all addresses in uppercase. Dropped duplicates for the merged DataFrame. Filtered the merged dataset only to include INC_TYPE within: INC_TYPE Description 14 Natural vegetation fire 140 Natural vegetation fire, other 141 Forest woods or wildland fire 142 Brush or brush-and-grass mixture fire 143 Grass fire At the end, we have a wildfire dataset that contains ID, INC_TYPE, FDID, CITY, STATE, and ZIP5 as columns for further analysis. 3.3 Missing Value Analysis CDC United States Drought Monitor (usdm) According to the documentation of usdm data set, “No data were lost or omitted during calculation. All data that were available were used. Data will be updated on an ad hoc basis, when necessary”. We also checked for missing values by calling the isnull() and isna() functions to confirm that the data set does not miss any values. To further confirm, we used plot_missing function from library redav to check the missing percentage and pattern. We can see from the graph that there are no missing values in the dataset and every variable is complete. Annual NFIRS (National Fire Incident Reporting System) Public Data We identified: during the preprocessing, in the combined incidents file there were 3693 missing values for the ‘STATE’ variable; in the fires data portion, there were 1125 missing values for the ‘STATE’ variable, and so not all incidents or fires had a full primary key or unique identifier. Considering the large size of the data set, millions of rows from 2004 - 2016, it was sufficient for our analysis to merge the dataset without addressing missing components of the primary key. NFIRS is also not reflective of the total number of wildfires in the United States, as is reported by the agency. Rather, analysis in NFIRS should be focused on changes, or trends in the number of reported wildfires over time and space. For this reason, ignoring incomplete IDs was deemed adequate, as the exact number of wildfires in NFIRS is not as important as the magnitude and changes in the data over time. We further verify after preprocessing that our wildfire dataset is complete below. We can see that the data, after preprocessing, was complete.

An additional column was added to the USDM database drought_condition, which is a factor mapping the drought conditions listed in the metadata to the numerical value. 4.2 USDM Database: Drought Trends Has drought become more common in the USA over the time period? Has the drought condition of the nation fluctuated over time? What sort of patterns are there? The USDM reports six levels of drought condition ranging from No Drought to Exceptional Drought. To analyze whether drought has become more common in the US from 2004-2016 and view the overall national drought trend, we can view the percent of time spent in the nation as a 100% stacked bar chart over each year, and a stacked area chart over each month. Creating a more granular stacked area chart to show the data each month reveals additional detail: There does not appear to be any linear trend for drought in the nation. However, it does appear the country has spent slightly more time in Abnormally Dry - Exceptional Drought periods from 2011-2016 than it has from 2004 - 2010, perhaps indicating drought is becoming slightly more common. There does not appear to be any recurring seasonality over the years. Rather, periods of drought seem to come and go through the years and seasons. 4.3 NFIRS Database: Wildfire Trends What about the number of wildfires? Has the number of wildfires recorded in NFIRS increased over the years? Is there a seasonality? We can create similar visualizations to the USDM data with the number of fires recorded in NFIRS. Similarly, we create a more granular bar chart to show the data each month: The NFIRS wildfires also do not have a clear linear trend from 2004 - 2016 in the number of wildfires. Number of wildfires does have more of a seasonality - more wildfires seem to occur near the middle of each year, which is also the hottest time of year. The number of wildfires by month does not yet seem to have a clear relationship to the drought trends - large nationwide trends in drought prevalence are not clearly mirrored in the number of wildfires, at least at the nationwide level. More analysis will be required to examine the relationship between these two datasets. 4.4 State and County-Wide Results We can investigate if any states or regions are particularly susceptible or resilient to drought. To do so, we can calculate the time each individual state spends in a drought. We can consider a drought any drought_condition other than Abnormally Dry as a drought state, and derive the time each state spends in a drought, each year. A merge with a dataset of FIPS, which relates a numeric code to a specific state and a specific county, is required for this exercise. To understand which states and regions are particularly dry, as well as the change in drought over time, we can create a parallel coordinate plot, plotting each state’s proportion in drought over time. We will plot every other year to reduce overplotting and color the points by geographic region. The North Central and Northeast regions seem to have the most cohesive sets of states - most states in these regions follow the same drought trends, while the states in the West and South have more variation. The nation as a whole follows a similar drought trend during some periods of time ie) 2010 - 2012 as most of the nation enters a drought, while some regions follow different trends during other periods ie) 2006 - 2008 where the South and North Central regions become more dry and less dry, respectively. Overall, the West appears to be the driest or most drought-prone region. There was a great deal of variation in drought conditions from 2012 - 2016 as pictured above, especially in the North Central region. For a closer look at the transformation, we can plot the percentage in drought for the year, by county nationwide, during each of these years. We see the same phenomenon occurring on the map - the North Central and South regions become less drought-stricken from 2012 - 2016 while the Northeast becomes more drought-stricken and the West remains very dry. Did the number of wildfires in these areas follow the same trend? We should investigate the maps from 2012-2016. If drought and wildfires are correlated, Northeastern states should show an above average number of wildfires in 2016 and below average in 2012, while North Central states should have the opposite trend. Creating this map will also require some additional merges - we will perform this exercise at the state level, rather than the county level, as many counties contain limited or no data in NFIRS. To do so we can use Z-score, standardizing the number of fires per year by state, and comparing the Z-score for each state in 2012 and 2016 to the entire timeframe (2004 - 2016). Each year, we can think of a state’s score as its relative number of wildfires, compared to its average year. There is one outlier from this analysis - the state of Wyoming, which had a z-score outside the range of [-3, 3]. This may be a data collection error or perhaps an extraneous event, but in either case this state was excluded. Overall, the map looks quite similar to the drought map - between 2012 and 2016 wildfires in the North Central and South Central regions move from a higher than average year to a normal to lower than average year of wildfires. Simultaneously, the Northeast transitions from a lower than average number of wildfires to a much higher than average number of wildfires. The similarity of these trends shows there is a correlation between a state’s percent of the year spent in drought, and the comparative rate of wildfires per year between 2012 and 2016. States that became more dry experienced a higher than average number of wildfires, and states that became less dry experienced a lower than average number of wildfires from 2012 - 2016. We can also summarize this phenomenon in a Cleveland Dot Plot, comparing 2012 and 2016. It is easier to see the trends with these two figures. Between 2012 and 2016, the North Central region became less dry, and also decreased in relative frequency of wildfires. The Northeast region entered a drought, and increased the relative frequency of wildfires. The South and West had varying results, depending on the state. 4.5 Comparing Drought to Wildfires Most of this analysis so far has concerned trends among drought and trends among wildfires, identifying similarities between the two. However, exploratory data analysis can be performed working with the two datasets together. To visualize the correlation between percent of the year spent in drought and the relative number of wildfires (Z-Score), we can create a scatterplot. Each data point will represent one state during one year - its percent in drought during that year and its z-score for the number of wildfires will be calculated and plotted. Overall there is a positive correlation between the percent of the year spent in drought, and the relative number of wildfires in a particular year. The correlation seems stronger in the Northeast, South and North Central regions than in the West. This is perhaps because the west is more drought-prone in general, meaning a small change in drought status does not make a large difference as the states are in a drought more years than not. The West is clearly the most drought-prone area, but a decrease in percent spent in drought, or a more wet year, does not seem to drastically impact the number of fires in Western states. For other regions, an increase in percent spent in drought is expected to increase the rate of wildfires. Drought is defined in the USDM database by multiple categories ranging from No Drought to Exceptional Drought. Using a merge between the NFIRS and USDM databases and a zipcode-to-county database, we can determine the county of each wildfire, and then the drought condition at that time using the year, week and county. We can then calculate the average number of wildfires per county, per week, for each drought condition. This will help us ultimately determine the comparative rate of wildfires at different drought conditions. We can see there is a correlation between the drought condition and the average number of wildfires per county per week. The largest jump occurs from the condition No Drought to Abnormally Dryand then from Abnormally Dry to Moderate Drought. After that, the rate of wildfires for each drought condition is similar. This means counties in a drought clearly have a higher rate of wildfires. We can view this data grouped as well, comparing the total time the country spent at each drought condition from 2004 - 2016 vs. the distribution of wildfires at the same drought condition. We can see that the country spent around 55% of the time in “No Drought” condition, but only 45% of wildfires occurred during that time. For all other drought conditions, the inverse relationship is true: a disproportionately high number of wildfires occurred while the country was in a drought. 4.6 Main Takeaways In the first part of analysis, we found the country seems to travel through periods of drought without any real seasonality or significant long-term development from 2004 - 2016. In addition, there were no obvious similarities in the nationwide number of wildfires each year vs. the national ‘dryness’. However, making our analysis more granular by region, state and county, we found the regions of the USA followed similar trends over time in drought condition and number of wildfires. Between 2012 and 2016 there were significant changes in many regions of the country. Regions that became drier during that timeframe also had relatively more wildfires. Regions that became less dry, or more wet, had relatively fewer wildfires. Directly merging the datasets together, we were able to correlate each state’s relative number of wildfires and percent of the year in drought, for each year. We found there was a positive correlation overall between the percent of time a state is in a drought, and the relative number of wildfires. The strength of this correlation varied with the geographic region. Finally, we found wildfires disproportionately occur when areas are in a drought. Although the nation was not in a drought for the majority of 2004 - 2016, the majority of wildfires occurred while the nation was in a drought. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive Component 5.1 Data Preprocessing for d3 Component 5.2 d3 Component Visualization", " Chapter 5 Interactive Component 5.1 Data Preprocessing for d3 Component The preprocessing for the interactive component consisted of calculating the number of wildfires per state, per year. We chose the subset of 2013 - 2016 for an interactive component, resulting in four tables, one per year, after preprocessing. Recall, the NFIRS database includes only a sample of total fire data. As such, rather than interpret the number of wildfires in each state as a raw number, it is more keen to track the number of NFIRS wildfires over time, observing a general trend. 5.2 d3 Component Visualization "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The main takeaway of this analysis was that there is a positive correlation overall between the percent of time spent in drought, and the relative number of wildfires a state or region experiences. The strength of this correlation varies by region - states that are not typically dry may experience a relatively extreme number of wildfires in a severe drought, while a more drought-prone state may have a more constant, though potentially high, number of fires. The limitations of this exploration was the completeness of the NFIRS databaset. As mentioned on the NFIRS site, the dataset is only a subset of the true number of fires that occur in the United States and should not be used to determine the total number of fires or total loss from fires for any given time. Because this data is only a subset, and is recorded by Fire Department personnel, there is a chance the dataset is not wholly reflective of the wildfires situation in the United States. There could be biases if certain states or regions are more active in recording NFIRS incidents. The data also had to be filtered to include certain wildfire-specific incident types. Because the incident type is determine by a human, there is potential for mis-classification as well as missing values. To deal with these challenges we did not use the raw number of wildfires in a state when comparing with drought - rather, we used the relative number of wildfires (z-score) in particular states, and examined trends in wildfires over time. For future analysis, it would be interesting to analyze data more in-depth at the county level. The USDM dataset contains extensive and high-quality county-wide data, but NFIRS was more useful at the state level (the county was not recorded in NFIRS incidents and had to be merged from zipcode). A more extensive wildfire dataset, or more extensive analysis on NFIRS, could reveal how drought affects wildfires in the most susceptible states, such as California.
