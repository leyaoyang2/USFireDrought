### Description

USFireDrought is a repository that contains code and materials used to analyze drought and wildfire trends in the United States. We use datasets from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) to examine and visualize features of both drought and wildfire as well as the relationships between the two variables. 

This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.
